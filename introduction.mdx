title: Terrakotta 2-way Sync

Integrating Kevin and Maggie's CRM with [Terrakotta](https://terrakotta.ai/)

<img className="block dark" src="/images/verger.png" />

## Proposed Approach
1. Kevin and Maggie pick a list of Contacts in their CRM client to send to Terrakotta
2. In Terrakotta, Kevin and Maggie make their calls and leave notes which Terrakotta tracks in 'Temporary DB'
3. Kevin and Maggie's CRM polls Terrakotta for updated Contacts and writes back to CRM on a job that runs every few hours. Terrakotta deletes 'Temporary DB' records once CRM has read them.

## Open Questions
1. What format are the CRM records in? What format should call notes be kept in?
2. Should the CRM and Terrakotta pass JSON back and forth?
3. Does the CRM have a ['Call' or 'Task'](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.tasks.htm&type=5) type of record?
